- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DimaChernov87
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning CSS, JavaScript and perfecting my Python skills.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript
- ðŸ“« How to reach me e-mail: dimachernov.cas@gmail.com

I live in Moscow, Russia. I graduated from radio-electronics college and received diploma in linguistics and interpretation (English language).
At some point I decided to change my career and study programming. So I finished beginner course in Python and started working on my pet project,
which is a vdeogame about recycling. It is hard for me to go through such a complex project and as my primary goal is to find a job in programming,
I started working on my skills of JS programming, because I already have experience in content management.
Please, feel free to write to me! I will be glad to talk to interesting people!
